Key Learnings and Skills Demonstrated:
Foundational Knowledge of Node.js
By implementing basic JavaScript functionality in a Node.js environment, I honed my understanding of how Node handles input/output operations, file system interaction, and HTTP server creation.

Mastery of Asynchronous Programming
Tasks like reading files asynchronously and working with Promises reinforced my ability to write non-blocking, efficient code. This is critical for applications where scalability and responsiveness are essential.

Handling Real-World Scenarios with Grace
Designing scripts to handle errors gracefully, such as managing missing files or incorrect user input, taught me the importance of building resilient and user-friendly systems.

Building Modular and Scalable Web Applications
The process of organizing a complex Express server—separating controllers, routes, and utilities—highlighted the importance of clean architecture and maintainable codebases in larger applications.

Working with CSV Data
Parsing CSV files and managing data efficiently showcased my ability to manipulate structured data, a skill relevant for backend services and data-driven applications.

Practical Experience with HTTP and REST APIs
By implementing HTTP servers using both Node’s built-in HTTP module and Express, I demonstrated my capability to design RESTful endpoints and serve content dynamically based on user requests.

Command-Line Interaction and Child Processes
Designing scripts executed via command-line arguments and working with child processes highlighted my ability to integrate backend scripts into larger system workflows.

Version Control and Collaboration
The structured GitHub repository and adherence to project guidelines reflect my understanding of collaborative development practices and version control.

Babel and Modern JavaScript Features
Leveraging Babel to enable ES6+ features in Node.js showcased my adaptability to modern JavaScript standards, ensuring compatibility while utilizing the latest language capabilities.

Why This Experience is Relevant:
This task mirrors real-world backend challenges, from building resilient applications to adhering to clean architecture principles. The ability to transition from basic Node.js functionality to a modular Express application demonstrates growth and adaptability, which are critical in dynamic development environments. These skills position me as a strong candidate capable of contributing to backend systems with reliability, scalability, and user-focus at their core.
